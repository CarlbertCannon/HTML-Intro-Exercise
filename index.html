                    As a store owner within Amazon, I learned all aspects of running a store underneath the banner of amazon. 
                    Everything from finding products, testing, cleaning, packing and shipping to varies warehouses. 
                    It was truly rewarding to work for myself in that compacity.

                   I start my day by checking emails. I handle any neccessary commnication that comes through there. 
                   And then I move on to putting away products from quality assurance and receiving. Once that is finished,
                   I pull orders for companies throughout the world. After I pull the product I stage them for shipping and 
                   processing. Here is where I will pack them up and set them up for shipping using Epicor. Once they are 
                   processed I place them in the right shipping area.

                    I would start my day with a department team meeting. This is where we all got our daily work instructions.
                    After the conclusion of the meeting we split off into smaller teams and went to our stations. As a locomotive 
                    operator I would perform a pre-shift check on varies component. From the brakes, to stearing and the electrical
                    system. If everything checked out I would start the locomotive to warm it up. After we were all set to go,
                    my lead conductor would tell me where to go. Operatoring a locomotive was all by feel and ear. 
                    We moved train cars to different points throughout the plant.

                    I completed the process of receiving my certification as a full stack software engineer, through their 
                    comprehensive training program. Which involved  over 500 hours of lecture and project based training.
                    Using varies programming languages and technical skills like C#, .Net, MySQL, Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    I like to meditate, hike, snowboard, workout and spend
                    time with my fiancee Bianca. We do many of those things together as well as taking turns cooking delicious 
                    meals for one another. We both love movies and learning to better ourselves in a multitude of ways.
